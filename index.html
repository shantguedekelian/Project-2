    <h2>Proposition: Carbon Dioxide and Greenhouse Gas emissions have followed the exact same trend over the years.</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
        <img src="for_plot.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption><em>Score: 1.5</em> This plot shows a side-by-side graph of greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions over time, highlighting their similar trends.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Data transformations: The original data was reported quarterly (e.g., “2015Q1”, “2015Q2”). We removed the
          quarter labels and kept only the year. We then grouped the data by year and calculated the mean, minimum, and
          maximum values across the four quarters. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Using yearly averages reduces short-term fluctuations, making the final plot smoother and easier to
            interpret.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Axis manipulation: The y-axis scales for greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide were adjusted independently,
          causing the line plots to look similar. Since we argue that the greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide follow the
          same trend, the magnitudes do not matter as long as we see that the trends are similar in both graphs. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The values are indeed similar in trend, but adjusting the axis increments makes it even more convincing as
            the resulting lines are incredibly similar. </li>
        </ul>

        <li>Gestalt Principle, figure: We plotted the range of min and max values which appear as the shadow of the
          graph, adding an additional layer of uncertainty to the graph. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The shadow forces the viewer to track three trends (min, max, average), increasing visual complexity and
            making direct comparisons harder.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Gestalt Principle, proximity: Separating the two graphs makes it much harder to compare the trends of the
          lines at the same time.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>This separation reduces direct comparability, making differences less noticeable. As a result, the viewer
            perceives the two trends as more similar and smoother than they might actually be.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
        <img src="against_plot.png" alt="" />
        <figcaption><em>Score: -1</em> This plot a stacked line graph, emphasizing the differences between greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions over time.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Data transformations, aggregation: We removed the quarter labels and kept only the year. We then grouped the
          data by year and calculated the mean of the four quarters. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Using yearly averages reduces short-term fluctuations, making the final plot smoother and easier to
            interpret.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Data transformation: The greenhouse gas values were raised to the power of 1.1 and shifted down by 400,
          while carbon dioxide values were raised to the power of 0.9 and shifted up by 160.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>These transformations intentionally stretch and compress each variable’s scale, making the two lines
            diverge and appear less correlated than they truly are.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Axis manipulation: Now the plots share the same x-axis (Year) and y-axis (Emissions), unlike the earlier
          version where axes were scaled separately.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This shared axis encourages direct comparison, but due to the nonlinear transformations, the viewer
            perceives a stronger difference between the two trends.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Gestalt principle, focal point: There is a noticeable dip in emissions corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        We added text annotation to highlight this point.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>This annotation creates a visual anchor that immediately draws the viewer’s attention to the dip. By
          emphasizing this divergence, the viewer perceives a stronger difference between greenhouse gas and carbon
          dioxide trends, reinforcing the argument that the two variables are not closely correlated, even though the
          underlying long-term trends are similar.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>The dataset we chose contained a large amount of information that could be interpreted and visualized in many
        different ways. Finding a topic that was both interesting and had enough depth to create persuasive or
        potentially deceptive visualizations took some time, but exploring the dataset more deeply revealed several
        viable options. Once we identified a clear focus, the process of aggregating and transforming the data was
        relatively straightforward. Because much of the data was continuous and numeric, it required fewer subjective
        choices during preprocessing, which helped maintain consistency across transformations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethical analysis is more than just showing the truth; the intent behind what we want to say is just as
        important. Even with accurate data, it is easy to manipulate it in a way that leads viewers toward a completely
        different conclusion. The different changes we made to our plots showed that even small visual adjustments can
        subtly guide or mislead the viewer. The line between persuasion and deception depends on how honest we are about
        our intentions. The narrative we build should be as truthful as the data itself, and the transformations we
        apply should remain transparent and justified. Once we begin to insert our own narrative or beliefs, the data
        reflects that bias, turning a visualization meant to inform into one that misleads.
